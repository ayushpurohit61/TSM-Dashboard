# TODO: Fix Error, Check Overlapping, and Start Again

## Tasks
- [x] Analyze FleetPage.tsx for errors and overlapping marker issues
- [x] Implement fix for overlapping markers on the map by adding small offsets for vehicles at the same location
- [x] Check for any other potential errors in the code (e.g., missing imports, type issues)
- [x] Run the development server to test the fixes and start the app again
- [x] Verify that markers are no longer overlapping and the app runs without errors

## Notes
- Overlapping markers occur because multiple vehicles can have the same lat/lng coordinates (e.g., same city)
- Solution: Add a small random or sequential offset to marker positions when rendering
- Ensure the offset is small enough not to misrepresent locations but enough to separate markers
